# Universal React Router 

> Opionated example of universal app setup with latest [React](https://facebook.github.io/react), [ReactRouter](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) and [Flux](https://github.com/acdlite/flummox). App shares the same ideas as my previous [Universal React Flux Boilerplate](https://github.com/voronianski/universal-react-flux-boilerplate) but without hot-reloading and with improved data-fetching due to [changes](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/blob/master/upgrade-guides/v2.0.0.md) in ReactRouter's API.

## Usage

```bash
git clone git@github.com:voronianski/universal-react-router-flux-2016.git
cd universal-react-router-flux-2016
npm install
npm start
```
